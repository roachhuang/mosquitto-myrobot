# mosquitto-myrobot
mosquitto version of myrobot

NOTE:
don't know why it is a must to set pinmode again for each motor movemnet; otherwise, the left motor can only move on one direction.
The robot won't move as expected if running out of batteries

L298N motor shield requires 12V input, so i gave up using it.
